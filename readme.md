# DAO for Digital-First Business Entities (Startups)

Welcome to the DAO implementation for startups, a next-gen digital-first business entity that provides an innovative and modular approach for decentralized autonomous organizations.

## Overview

In the current digital era, startups require a new way to manage their operations, take decisions, allocate resources, and evolve. Traditional methods can be cumbersome and do not scale well with the dynamic nature of modern startups. This DAO is crafted to cater to the needs of these startups and help them seamlessly integrate decentralized decision-making and operations.

## Key Features:

1. **Modular Design**: The architecture is built with separation of concerns, dividing different functionalities into separate modules like `admin`, `founder`, `investor`, etc. This ensures the codebase remains maintainable and easily upgradable.
2. **Integrated Voting Mechanism**: Startups can create proposals, and members can vote on them. This makes decision-making transparent and democratic.
3. **Investment Handling**: The DAO has provisions for handling investors, their stakes, and their rights.
4. **Milestone Tracking**: A built-in system for startups to track their progress, achieve milestones, and report back to stakeholders.
5. **Transparent Event Logging**: Every major action on the DAO is logged as an event, ensuring transparency and traceability.

## Code Structure:

### Modules:

- **admin**: Handles administrative functions and rights.
- **founder**: Manages founder-specific operations.
- **investor**: Takes care of investor-related functionalities.
- **proposal**: Facilitates creation, management, and execution of proposals.
- **voting**: Provides mechanisms for voting on proposals.
- **execution**: Manages the execution of accepted proposals.
- **milestone**: Allows the setup and tracking of project milestones.
- **event**: Logs significant DAO actions.
- **storage_types**: Manages the storage data structures for the contract.
- **metadata**: Deals with metadata operations, such as reading and writing.

### Events:

Our DAO emits various events to indicate major actions. This helps in transparency, logging, and auditing. Some significant events include:

- **Proposal Creation**
